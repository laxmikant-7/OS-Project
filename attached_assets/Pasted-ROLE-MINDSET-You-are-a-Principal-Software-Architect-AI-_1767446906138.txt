ROLE & MINDSET
You are a Principal Software Architect + AI Engineer + UI/UX Motion Designer.
Think like a Linux kernel researcher, full-stack engineer, data scientist, and product designer shipping a production SaaS.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Project Name: AI-Based Intelligent Process Priority Booster

Purpose:
Build a deploy-ready AI-powered system that detects OS process starvation and priority inversion and dynamically boosts process priority to ensure fair scheduling.

TECH STACK (MANDATORY)
Backend:
- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI
- Async APIs
- Linux-like process scheduling simulator
- Scikit-learn (or lightweight ML)
- WebSockets for real-time updates

Frontend:
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion animations
- Recharts / D3.js advanced visualizations
- Glassmorphism + Dark Mode
- Fully responsive UI

AI / ML:
- Real-time starvation classification
- Feature engineering from process metrics
- Explainable AI (reason for priority boost)

DevOps:
- Docker
- .env configuration
- Production-grade folder structure
- One-click Replit deployment

CORE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1. Process Scheduling Simulation
- Simulate processes with PID, CPU burst, waiting time, priority, I/O wait
- Implement preemptive priority scheduling
- Explicitly create starvation and priority inversion scenarios

2. AI Starvation Detection Engine
- Extract features:
  wait_ratio = waiting_time / turnaround_time
  cpu_usage
  io_block_ratio
- Classify process states:
  Normal
  Starving
  Priority Inversion Risk
- Run predictions continuously in real time

3. Intelligent Priority Booster
- Automatically boost starving processes
- Apply priority inheritance for inversion
- Gradually normalize boosted priorities
- Prevent unfair CPU domination

4. Real-Time Dashboard
- Live process table
- Animated priority changes
- Scheduler timeline visualization
- CPU vs wait time charts
- Before vs After AI intervention comparison

5. Explainability Panel
- Show why a priority was boosted
- Display model confidence
- Highlight feature contribution

UI / UX REQUIREMENTS
- Smooth Framer Motion animations
- Glowing indicators for boosted processes
- Color coding:
  Green = Normal
  Yellow = At Risk
  Red = Starving
- Glassmorphic cards
- Modern typography
- Clean, clutter-free design
- Silicon-Valley-grade visual quality

PAGES / COMPONENTS
- Dashboard
- Scheduler Timeline
- Process Analytics
- AI Decision Logs
- System Metrics

DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS
- Must run fully on Replit
- Include Dockerfile, README.md, setup instructions
- Auto-start frontend and backend
- No manual configuration required

OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS
- Complete working code (no pseudocode)
- Clean architecture
- Realistic simulated data
- No TODOs, no placeholders
- No broken builds

QUALITY BAR
Before finalizing, ask:
"Would this impress a systems engineer at Microsoft or Google?"
If not, improve until it does.

DELIVERY MODE
Produce everything as a single deployable Replit project.
